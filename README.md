Monorepo are the architecture or method to manage a fullstack software or  which contains all the
multiple projects (apps,packages,utils,services) all togther by sharing the same packages  instead of splitting
it into the multiple repos

```bash
apps/
  frontend/     ← React app
  backend/      ← Express app
packages/
  utils/        ← shared logic
  validation/   ← shared schemas
```
